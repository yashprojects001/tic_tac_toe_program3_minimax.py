Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize the Tic-Tac-Toe board
Step 3: Display the board
Step 4: Accept human move
Step 5: Check for terminal state (win or draw)
Step 6: Generate all possible AI moves
Step 7: Apply Minimax recursively to evaluate future states
Step 8: Select the move with the highest evaluation value
Step 9: Make AI move
Step 10: Repeat until game ends
Step 11: Stop
