# 🧠 Tic-Tac-Toe AI – Program 3 (Minimax)

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game using **Python** and the **Minimax algorithm**.  
The AI evaluates all possible future game states and selects the optimal move assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

---

## AI Technique
Search-Based Artificial Intelligence using the Minimax Algorithm

---

## How Minimax Works
- AI tries to maximize its winning chances
- Opponent is assumed to minimize AI’s chances
- All possible future moves are explored recursively
- Each board state is evaluated using a scoring function

---

## Evaluation Strategy
- Win  → +1
- Draw → 0
- Loss → -1

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Minimax Algorithm
- Console-based Interface

---

## Features
- Optimal AI (never loses)
- Look-ahead decision making
- No hard-coded rules
- Textbook-aligned implementation

---

## Future Enhancements
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- GUI using Tkinter
- Depth-limited Minimax
- Larger board games
